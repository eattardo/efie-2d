# efie-2d
Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) numerical solver for 2D arbitrary and inhomogeneous objects with cylindrical symmetry.

This numerical solver has been adapted to C++ from its original implementation available in my dissertation (see www.eattardo.info/resume, Ph.D. Thesis, Chapter 4 "Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering: Integral Formulation").

Further details about the code can be used on the Wiki page of the project (https://github.com/eattardo/efie-2d/wiki).
